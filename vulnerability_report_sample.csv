  - An Out Of Bounds (OOB) access vulnerability in the handling of responses by a Juniper Agile License (JAL)     Client in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, configured in Network Mode (to use Juniper Agile     License Manager) may allow an attacker to cause a partial Denial of Service (DoS), or lead to remote code     execution (RCE). The vulnerability exists in the packet parsing logic on the client that processes the     response from the server using a custom protocol. An attacker with control of a JAL License Manager, or     with access to the local broadcast domain, may be able to spoof a new JAL License Manager and/or craft a     response to the Junos OS License Client, leading to exploitation of this vulnerability.

  - An improper privilege management vulnerability in the Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved     command-line interpreter (CLI) allows a low-privileged user to overwrite local files as root, possibly     leading to a system integrity issue or Denial of Service (DoS).

  - An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP daemon (jdhcpd)     of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker sending a malformed DHCP packet     to cause a crash of jdhcpd and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS).

  - A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Layer-2 control protocols daemon     (l2cpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to     cause a memory leak. Continued exploitation can lead to memory exhaustion and thereby a Denial of Service     (DoS). This issue occurs when specific LLDP packets are received. The impact of the l2cpd cores is that if     any of the stp protocols (rstp, mstp or vstp) is used then stp re-converges and traffic loss will occur     during that time. Also if any services depend on LLDP state (like PoE or VoIP device recognition) then     these will also be affected.

  - A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Public Key Infrastructure daemon     (pkid) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated networked attacker to cause Denial of     Service (DoS). In a scenario where Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is used in combination with Certificate     Revocation List (CRL), if the CRL fails to download the memory allocated to store the CRL is not released.

  - An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP daemon (jdhcpd)     of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker sending a malformed DHCP packet     to cause a crash of jdhcpd and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS). If option-82 is configured in a DHCP     snooping / -security scenario, jdhcpd crashes if a specific malformed DHCP request packet is received. The     DHCP functionality is impacted while jdhcpd restarts, and continued exploitation of the vulnerability will     lead to the unavailability of the DHCP service and thereby a sustained DoS.

  - A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Layer-2 control protocols daemon     (l2cpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to     cause a memory leak. Continued exploitation can lead to memory exhaustion and thereby a Denial of Service     (DoS). This issue occurs when specific LLDP packets are received. The impact of the l2cpd cores is that if     any of the stp protocols (rstp, mstp or vstp) is used then stp re-converges and traffic loss will occur     during that time. Also if any services depend on LLDP state (like PoE or VoIP device recognition) then     these will also be affected. The memory utilization of the L2CPd process can be monitored with the     following command: user@host> show system processes extensive | match l2cpd 1234 root 52 0 521M 43412K RUN     1 4:02 34.47% l2cpd This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 18.4 version 18.4R2-S4 and later     versions prior to 18.4R2-S10. 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to     19.3R3-S5; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S7; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S3; 20.2 versions prior to     20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to     21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2; Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to     20.4R3-S2-EVO; 21.1 version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-EVO.
